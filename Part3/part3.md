# Tutorial: Apply Image Transformations with the JavaScript SDK

## Meta description

Build a simple HTML/CSS/JS app that uses the Cloudinary JavaScript SDK to load images and apply transformations like resizing, text overlays, and effects.

---

## Overview

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll build a simple HTML/CSS/JS app that:

* Loads an image from Cloudinary.
* Renders it in the browser.
* Applies a transformation at the click of a button.

**Time to complete:** 10 minutes.

You can try out the final app here:

## Introduction

### Why use image transformations?

Transformations let you dynamically resize, crop, adjust quality, and apply effects to your media. This ensures every user receives an optimized version without needing to create or store multiple files.

### Why use the JavaScript SDK?

Transformations can be applied by manually constructing delivery URLs. However, the JavaScript SDK makes this process simpler and less error-prone by providing a clear, chainable API for defining transformations in code. Behind the scenes, both approaches achieve the same result.

## 1. Prepare the HTML and CSS scaffold

This tutorial focuses on the Cloudinary JavaScript SDK. To keep things simple, the HTML and CSS are provided for you.

**Project layout**

```
/ (project root)
â”œâ”€ index.html
â””â”€ styles.css
```

### index.html

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <title>Cloudinary Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
    <div class="main-photo">
      <img id="main-img" src="" width="500" />
    </div>
    <div class="btn-group">
      <div class="btn" id="text-btn">Text overlay</div>
      <div class="btn" id="crop-btn">Crop to square</div>
      <div class="btn" id="cartoon-btn">Cartoonify <br>&nbsp;</br></div>
      <div class="btn" id="genremove-btn">Generative Remove</div>
      <div class="btn" id="reset-btn">Reset</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script type="module">
    // JavaScript code will go here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### styles.css

```css
.main {
  width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
}
.main-photo {
  width: 500px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 20px 0;
  display: inline-block;
}
.main-photo img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
}
.btn-group {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}
.btn {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 2px 5px;
  float: left;
  width: 70px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
.btn:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

The page shows an empty image frame (just the border) with the row of buttons underneath. The image area is intentionally blank because the `<img>` element has no `src`. We'll populate it with an image in Step 2.

---

## 2. Load an image from Cloudinary

From this step onward, we'll only update the JavaScript section of our project.

Replace the comment placeholder in `index.html` with the following code. It imports the URL-Gen SDK and creates a `CloudinaryImage object`, which represents an image stored in a Cloudinary account.

```js
import { Cloudinary } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@cloudinary/url-gen";

const CLOUD_NAME = "demo";
const PUBLIC_ID  = "sample.jpg";

const cld = new Cloudinary({ cloud: { cloudName: CLOUD_NAME } });

let myImage = cld.image(PUBLIC_ID);
```

In this example, we use the Cloudinary demo account (`demo`), which already contains the `sample.jpg` image. Later, you can replace these with your own cloud name and asset by following the instructions at the end of this tutorial.

---

## Step 3: Render the image

Add the following code to update the `<img>` element's src with the URL generated from the `CloudinaryImage` object. A helper function keeps the code reusable:

```js
const imgEl = document.getElementById("main-img");

function renderImage(imageElement, cloudinaryImage) {
  imageElement.src = cloudinaryImage.toURL();
}

renderImage(imgEl, myImage);
```

## Step 3: Add the Cartoonify button

To implement Cartoonify, add the following import statement:

```js
import { cartoonify } from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/@cloudinary/url-gen/actions/effect";
```

Add a click listener to the button. When clicked, apply the effect to the `CloudinaryImage` and re-render:

```js
cartoonBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  myImage.effect(cartoonify());
  renderImage(imgEl, myImage);
});
```

### Whatâ€™s happening

`myImage` is a **mutable builder object**. Each call you make, such as `.effect(cartoonify())`, appends a transformation to it. Because of this, the same instance can be reused and simply re-rendered after changes.
