# Image URL Transformation Challenge

In this challenge, I experimented with Cloudinary transformation URLs to achieve a given end result, and also added my name on top of the image.

## Final Result
The final URL I created is:  
<placeholder for URL>  

The images are:

## Key Takeaways
1. **Docs are awesome** – At first, I used the console to play with transformations, but once I explored the documentation and saw all the images and examples, I found it much more convenient.  
2. **Shadows were tricky** – At first, I tried using drop shadow and even outline, but eventually the shadow transformation gave me what I needed. I wasn’t entirely happy applying the same transformation four times, but I couldn’t find a better approach—which leads me to the next point...  
3. **Consulting with AI** – I used the Cloudinary bot mainly to ask about shadows (to check if repeating the transformation was best practice). But I must confess—I also consulted ChatGPT quite a bit. Maybe it’s just because I’m used to it, but it definitely helped.
