# Interactive Image Transformer app

This repo contains the source code of a simple HTML/CSS/JS app with the Cloudinary JavaScript SDK to load, render, and transform images.  
The same code was duplicated into the `docs` folder so it can be served via GitHub Pages and played with here: [Live Demo](https://mhornstein.github.io/Cloudinary-Test/)

## My Process - Key Takeaways

1. **Deciding what not to include** - At first, I considered adding a text field to show the generated transformation URL with the transformation part highlighted, to demonstrate its equivalence to the code. Although I implemented it, I decided to leave it out to keep the article focused and avoid adding unnecessary technical complexity, as the main goal is to teach usage of the JavaScript SDK, not the URL equivalence.

2. **Aligning code style with other guides** - I aimed to follow Cloudinary's naming conventions (e.g., `myImage` variable name) to keep the examples consistent.
