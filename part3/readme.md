# Interactive Image Transformer Tutorial

This repo contains a tutorial on building a simple HTML/CSS/JS app with the Cloudinary JavaScript SDK to load, render, and transform images.

## My Process - Key Takeaways

### 1. Picking the right inspiration

I needed inspiration to set the tone and direction of the article (like creating a moodboard, but for documentation). Cloudinary blog posts were helpful for ideas, but not the right fit. The [JavaScript quick start](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_quick_start) and [integration guide](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_integration) gave me the right kind of inspiration to build from.

### 2. Building a systematic structure

While working, I realized I needed a consistent structure for the steps - both to make my writing more consistent and to help the reader get familiar with the flow. I decided that each step would follow this pattern:

1. Short sentence explaining what and why.
2. The code.
3. Explanation of the code (optional).
4. "Try it yourself" tweaks (optional).
5. Image illustrating the expected output.
6. Link to docs for further information.

### 3. Using microcopy to add value

Even though this is a technical tutorial, I didn't want to miss opportunities to highlight the value of Cloudinary's features. Microcopy helped turn plain instructions into subtle "mini-marketing".

Two examples:

* **Quick Background** – Instead of jumping straight into transformations, I explained why transformations and the SDK matter. This shows not just how they work, but the direct value they bring to developers.
* **Text overlay** – I could have shown only the syntax, but I emphasized its usefulness for captions, labels, and notes. This highlights how the feature saves developers from creating duplicate image assets.
