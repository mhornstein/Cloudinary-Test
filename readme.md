# Cloudinary Interview Test

This repository contains my solutions to the Cloudinary interview test.

Each part is organized in its own folder and includes the corresponding deliverable. A short README in each folder highlights key takeaways and provides context for specific design and implementation decisions.

The `docs` folder contains the source code for Part 2, which is served via GitHub Pages and is available here: [Live Demo](https://mhornstein.github.io/Cloudinary-Test/).
