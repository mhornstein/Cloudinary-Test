# Cloudinary Interview Test

This repository contains my solutions to the Cloudinary interview test.

Each part is organized in its own folder and includes the corresponding deliverable. A short README in each folder highlights key takeaways and provides context for specific design and implementation decisions.

The `docs` folder contains a copy of the `Part 2` source code, which is required to serve the [application](https://mhornstein.github.io/Cloudinary-Test/) through GitHub Pages.
